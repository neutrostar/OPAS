# OPAS
Capstone Project (Online judge for college)

Why OPAS?
Because there are not many, if any, online judges available for collegiate uses. We want to finish the era where programming assignments are submitted as PDFs. It's really stupid.

OPAS is built upon electron by GitHub and will always remain free and open-source.

For any query, issue a new PR.

The team would love to hear your comments.
